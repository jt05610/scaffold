    coils:
        - name: coil_1
          desc: Coils are binary read/write registers. They are used to execute on/off functions on the target device
          params:
            - value:
                type: int
                desc: Writing 0 will write 0 to the device. Writing anything else will write 1.
        - name: coil_2
          desc: They can also be parameter-less if you want
    discrete_inputs:
        - name: discrete_input_1
          desc: Discrete inputs are binary read only registers
        - name: discrete_input_2
          desc: Add a new one like this
    holding_registers:
        - name: holding_register_1
          desc: Holding registers are 16-bit read/write registers. They are used to set variables on the device, and can execute a if desired
          params:
            - value:
                type: int
                desc: Whatever you write will be converted to a uint16
        - name: holding_register_2
          desc: Add a new one like this
          params:
            - value:
                type: int
                desc: You technically don't need to include a parameter but you probably should
    input_registers:
        - name: input_register_1
          desc: Input registers are 16-bit read only registers
        - name: input_register_2
          desc: Add a new one like this
